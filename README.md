### Project: Airgead Banking Investment Calculator
**Student:** Shaveze McDonald

**Project Summary:**  
This program lets a user see how their investment can grow over time. The user enters details like starting amount, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of years. The program calculates compound interest and shows a yearly report of the balance and interest earned. It solves the problem of helping people understand how consistent investing and compound interest can build wealth.

**What I Did Well:**  
I did well organizing my code into separate files (`Investment.h`, `Investment.cpp`, and `main.cpp`). The program runs smoothly, gives clear results, and the table format looks professional and easy to read.

**What I Could Improve:**  
I could improve the program by adding more input checks and error handling. That would make it more secure if users entered invalid input. I could also add more options, like graphs or exporting results to a file, to make it more user-friendly.

**Most Challenging Part and How I Solved It:**  
The hardest part was setting up the compound interest calculations and making sure the math was correct for each year. I solved this by testing different values, using debugging in Visual Studio, and checking the math manually until the numbers matched what I expected.

**Tools and Resources Used:**  
Visual Studio, course examples, C++ documentation, and online tutorials all helped me understand how to structure classes and functions properly.

**Transferable Skills:**  
This project improved my skills in C++ syntax, classes, and functions. I also learned how to separate code into header and source files and format output in tables — skills that transfer to any coding or software development project.

**Making the Program Readable and Maintainable:**  
I used clear variable names, comments to explain each function, and clean spacing. I also made the code modular, so I could easily add new features later without breaking the main logic.
